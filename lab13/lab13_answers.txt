Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab5_code.asm. Identify the cause of each error.


Errors:
14: illegal operands for missing opcode
 16: instruction appears before .ORIG
 17: constant outside of allowed range
 19: illegal operands for ADD
 30: constant outside of allowed range
 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared
 35: constant outside of allowed range
 43: no .END directive found

14: for the first line of code 'x3000' is illegal for no opcode *(missing .ORIG )
16:Missing .ORIG END will cause the error message.
17: the number is out of the range of LD*(x3010)
19: Two comma between R3 and R3, remove one
30: the number is out of the range of LD *(x300F)
32: Cannot recognize the opcode, Should be BRzp *(not pz)
35: x3011 out of the range of ST
43: Missing .END


Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location.

OUTERLOOP:x3004

INNERLOOP:x3005

INPUT:x3014

ZERO: x0000
N1: XFFFF
OUTPUT:x0000






Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which
one makes the most sense, and why?






Labels,for they are esay to read and when the PCoffset number change, the label still
remains the same.
