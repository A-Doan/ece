My algorithm is right, but I made some mistake, which lead my program fail:

1. I use non-English “,” and “;”,it may cause a problem when assemble. :(

2. I use a counter, and I forget that it will counts n+1 times, if it starts from zero.So now I minus the counter by 1*(10loops,from 0-9), and fix it.

3. For the TRAP x25 instruction. I did a typo when I enter the binary representation of x25. Now I fix it.
